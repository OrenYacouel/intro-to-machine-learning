Assignment 1 - Implementing the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm, and testing it on the MNIST data set. Then answering theoretical questions about Hypothesis and PAC bounds. 

Assignment 2 - Implementing the Soft SVM algorithm and the Soft-margin kernel SVM algorithm and testing them the MNIST data set. Then answering theoretical questions about kernels and the representer theorem.

Assignment 3 - Implementing the k-means and ridge-regression algorithms and testing them the MNIST data set. Then answering theoretical questions about Gradient Descent, Neural networks, Decision trees, PCA and MLE.
